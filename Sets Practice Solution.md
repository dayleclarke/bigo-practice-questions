# Sets Solution

## Question 1

The following questions relate to set_1 and set_2

set_1 = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10}  
set_2 = {3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19}  
domain =  {x | x E N ; x < 20}

a. set_1 union set_2=  {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19}  
b. The intersection of set_1 and set_2= {3, 5, 7, 10}  
c. The complement of set_1 and set_2 = {4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18}  
d. What is set_1 - set_2?  {1, 2}  
e. What is set_2 - set_1? {14,19}  
f. What is the symmetric difference between set_1 and set_2? {1, 2 , 14, 19}

## Question 2

The following questions relate to set_1 and set_2

set_1 = {-8, -2, 0, 6, 7, 8}  
set_2 = {-9, -8, 0, 5, 7, 8}  
domain =  {x | x E Z ; -10 < x < 10}

a. What is the union of set_1 and set_2? {-9, -8, -2, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8}  
b. What is the intersection of set_1 and set_2? {-8, 0, 7, 8}  
c. What is the complement of set_1 and set_2?  {-7, -6,-5, -4, -3, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9}  
d. What is set_1 - set_2? {-2, 6}  
e. What is set_2 - set_1? {-9, 5}  
f. What is the symmetric difference between set_1 and set_2? {-9, -2, 5, 6}

## Question 3

The following questions relate to set_1 and set_2

set_1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}  
set_2 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34}

Fill in the blanks in the following sentences:

Set_1 is a proper subset of Set_2.  This means it is also a subset.  
Set_2 is a proper superset of Set_1. This means it is also a superset.  

## Question 4

State the set described in the following set notatations:
a. set_1 = {x | x E Z}  = all the postive and negative integers
b. set_2 = {x | x E N}  = all integers above zero
c. set_3 = {x | x E N; x < 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4}
d. set_4 = {x | x E Z; -5 < x < 5}  = {-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
e. set_5 = {x | x E N; x < 10; NOT E set_3}= {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
